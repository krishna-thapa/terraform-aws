# Terraform outputs

- Terraform keeps attributes of all the resources you create
- e.g: the aws_instance resource has the attribute public_ip
- Those attributes can be queried and outputted
- This can be useful just to output valuable information or to feed information to external software
- Useful for instance to start automation scripts after infrastructure provisioning
